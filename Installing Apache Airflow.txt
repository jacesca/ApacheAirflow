[Practice] Installing Apache Airflow
Installing Apache Airflow


Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's time to install Apache Airflow. As you are going to see, it's very simple.



Prerequisites

First, make sure you have installed Docker Desktop and Visual Studio. If not, take a look at these links:

Get Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

Get Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Docker needs privilege rights to work, make sure you have them.

Follow the documentation first
If you have troubles to install these tools, here are some videos to help you

Install Apache Airflow with Docker



Create a folder materials in your Documents

In this folder, download the following file: docker compose file --> (saved already) https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.3.0/docker-compose.yaml

If you right click on the file and save it, you will end up with docker-compose.yaml.txt. Remove the .txt and keep docker-compose.yaml

Open your terminal or CMD and go into Documents/materials

Open Visual Studio Code by typing the command: code .

You should have something like this


Right click below docker-compose.yml and create a new file .env (don't forget the dot before env)

In this file add the following lines

AIRFLOW_IMAGE_NAME=apache/airflow:2.3.0
AIRFLOW_UID=50000
and save the file


Go at the top bar of Visual Studio Code -> Terminal -> New Terminal


In your new terminal at the bottom of Visual Studio Code, type the command docker-compose up -d and hit ENTER


You will see many lines scrolled, wait until it's done. Docker is downloading Airflow to run it. It can take up to 5 mins depending on your connection. If Docker raises an error saying that it can't download the docker image, make sure you are not behind a proxy/vpn or corporate network. You may need to use your personal connection to make it work. At the end, you should end up with something like this:


Well done, you've just installed Apache Airflow with Docker! ðŸŽ‰



Open your web browser and go to localhost:8080


Troubleshoots
If you don't see this page, make sure you have nothing already running on the port 8080

Also, go back to your terminal on Visual Studio Code and check your application with docker-compose ps

All of your "containers" should be healthy as follow:


If a container is not healthy. You can check the logs with docker logs materials_name_of_the_container

Try to spot the error; once you fix it, restart Airflow with docker-compose down then docker-compose up -d

and wait until your container states move from starting to healthy.

If you still have trouble, reach me on the Q/A with your error.
